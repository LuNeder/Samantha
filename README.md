# Samantha
Samantha - or, for short, Sam - is the Super Account Manager

## But what is it?
Sam can create and manage accounts, for any purpose you'd like. An internal blog, a social media website, a file server or whatever you can do with it!

## Features include:
- Fully customizeable:
    - Most of the features below can be disabled or heavily configurated/modified
- Create accounts in Sam's filesystem, that can include:
    - Name
    - Username
    - E-mail
    - Password
    - Phone
    - Pronouns
    - Many more, since Samantha is fully configurable. Those are just the defaults, but you can configure it to ask as many info as you want or as few info as you want (Want to ask for a password, and nothing more? You can! Want to ask the user for extra info? You also can!)
- Edit those accounts:
    - Everything can be edited! Samantha is developed in a way that allows everything to be changed, including usernames and e-mails.
    - The old username can redirect to the new one while a new account with the same username  as the old one is not created.
- Account deletion, keeping data:
    - The account is pubicly disabled, but it stays in Sam's filesystem, meaning it can be reactivated at any time.
- Account deletion, deleting all data:
    - The account will be completely deleted from Samantha, keeping no files of that account
    - A delay can be set (default: 30 days) before deleting the data, in case the user accidentally chooses the permanent deletion option.
- Posts (for social media, etc)
    - Create, edit or delete social media like posts. Posts will be saved as files (see below where they're stored)
- Files (for file storage providers, etc)
    - Files can be stored in the user's account, making possible the storage of files by the user. Samantha doesn't provides a file manager yet, but the files directory is created in the user's account.
    


**THIS README IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Idk the title for this yet
- Samantha can be run as-is at terminal interactivelly. If you need Samantha to run in backend using values given by another program or by a file, that is possible with minor modifications to the code. Pull requests containing a way to do this without removing the interactive option, with or without automated mode detection, are very welcome!

## The name
Sam stands for Super Account Manager and Sam is short for Samantha (actually, the Samantha name came before the Super Account Manager thing)

Samantha uses she/her pronouns
